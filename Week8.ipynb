A convultion (a calculation in the form of another grid/matrix) is done on this image grid, through which the model can recognize patterns such as edges. Additional grids can be added with additional calculations to recognize a different pattern, and so on and so forth. The result of the convolution is what is called a convoluted matrix. Note that after convolution, you can apply an activation function, for example relu, to establish a non-linear relationship.\n",
